# Overview
This Project was given as an Assignment in the EN203 Thermodynamics course to Energy Science and Engineering Students at the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay.

# Outline
Otto Cycle analysis done on python through Linear Regression and visualisation is done through the matplotlib library. 

# Abstract
Each group was given a distinct data set which contained various values of Average Pressure (kPa), Volume (cc) and Cracking Angle (degrees), corresponding to various stages of an Otto Cycle for a given engine. The Otto Cycle taking place in the real world, seems to yield a non-ideal output. This report contains the analysis of the data set given to Group 5, by plotting graphs, comparing the situation with ideal cases via computations as well as graphically, and finding error percentage in the non-ideal case.
